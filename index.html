    <h1>Terms of Chat Engagement</h1>
    <div class="effective-date">Effective Date: October 17th, 2025</div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Preamble</h2>
        <p>This document ("Terms") outlines the conditions for engaging in electronic communication ("the Chat") with me, @other1side ("I," "me," "my"). By initiating or continuing a Chat with me, you ("you," "the User") agree to abide by these Terms, which are designed to make our interaction clear and comfortable for both of us. The nature of this agreement is detailed in Article 1.</p>
        <p>For the purpose of these Terms, the words "we," "our," and "us" refer to you and me collectively, as the parties engaged in the Chat. These Terms create a two-way agreement, establishing expectations and rights for both of us in this interaction.</p>
        <p>If you do not agree with these conditions, you must cease all communication with me immediately.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Benefits of These Terms:</strong> By agreeing to these Terms, you can expect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> You will always know where you stand and what is expected.</li>
            <li><strong>A Safe Environment:</strong> I am committed to enforcing these rules to ensure our interaction is free from the harassment and drama that can plague online spaces.</li>
            <li><strong>My Full Attention:</strong> Because these boundaries allow me to feel secure, I can be more present and engaged in our conversation.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>A Note on Formality</h2>
        <p>I understand that a formal document for a private chat is unusual. These Terms are not a reflection of my personality, but a tool I use to prevent the harassment and boundary violations I have experienced in the past. They allow me to feel safe enough to engage openly. Thank you for understanding.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Article 1: Nature of Our Interaction and Enforcement</h2>
        <h3>1.1. Purpose and Asymmetry</h3>
        <p>These Terms exist because I value my privacy and well-being. Our chat is a voluntary interaction, and I find that clear boundaries help make such interactions positive and sustainable. The enforcement mechanisms described herein are the tools I use to maintain these personal boundaries.</p>
        
        <h3>1.2. Universal Tools</h3>
        <p>The tools for managing online interactions — ceasing response, blocking, or reporting — are universally available to all users on digital platforms. These are not special privileges I created for myself; they are fundamental features of the platforms we use.</p>
        <p>Your rights in this interaction are exactly the same as mine in this regard. You have the absolute right to cease communication with me, block my account, or report my messages if you find our interaction unsatisfactory, for any reason. You do not need my permission or these Terms to exercise these rights.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this document is not to grant myself unique powers, but to transparently communicate how I will use these universal tools to protect my personal boundaries. My commitment to you is that I will use them proportionally and based on the objective criteria outlined in these Terms, rather than arbitrarily.</p>
        
        <h3>1.3. My Commitments to Fairness</h3>
        <p>While I set these rules to protect my personal space, I commit to enforcing them in a way that is reasonable and fair. Specifically, I commit to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Objectivity:</strong> Basing my decisions on the specific, objective criteria outlined in these Terms, not on my subjective mood.</li>
            <li><strong>Proportionality:</strong> Matching my response (e.g., a warning vs. a block) to the severity and persistence of the violation.</li>
            <li><strong>Good-Faith Interpretation:</strong> Assuming you are engaging in good faith, as stated in Article 3.4.</li>
            <li><strong>Finality:</strong> My enforcement decisions (like blocking) are final. This is not to be punitive, but because engaging in a debate about a boundary violation is, in itself, a draining and often harmful interaction for me. This allows me to protect my peace and end stressful interactions definitively.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Article 2: Scope and Platform</h2>
        <h3>2.1. Application</h3>
        <p>These Terms govern our direct, one-on-one communication, regardless of the digital platform used, including but not limited to: Discord, Steam direct messages, Telegram, and Tumblr.</p>
        
        <h3>2.2. Platform Rules</h3>
        <p>We both remain subject to the terms of service and community guidelines of the platform we are using. You are responsible for your compliance with those rules, and I may report activities that violate them to the platform administrators.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Article 3: Mutual Conduct and Respect</h2>
        <h3>3.1. General Conduct</h3>
        <p>We both agree to engage in the Chat in a respectful and lawful manner.</p>
        
        <h3>3.2. Unacceptable Conduct</h3>
        <p>To ensure a positive interaction for both of us, you agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Send content that is harassing, threatening, defamatory, obscene, or hateful.</li>
            <li>Use the Chat for unsolicited advertising or commercial solicitation.</li>
            <li>Impersonate any person or entity.</li>
            <li>Transmit any malicious software or code.</li>
            <li>Make unreasonably persistent demands after a boundary has been set. This is objectively defined as: repeating a question or making a demand after I have explicitly stated I will not answer it, or sending more than 3 consecutive messages on the same topic without a response. This rule is specifically aimed at preventing badgering and spam-like behavior, not at stifling enthusiastic or detailed sharing.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3.3. Context and Interpretation</h3>
        <p>The prohibition in Article 3.2(a) targets the act of directing harmful content at a person, not the discussion of difficult subjects. To ensure clarity, the following standards apply:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Providing Context:</strong> If you plan to share content that is graphically violent, sexually explicit, or otherwise intensely disturbing (e.g., detailed descriptions of extreme gore, sexual violence, self-harm, or cruelty to animals), please provide a clear warning and context first (e.g., "Can I talk about a violent scene from a movie I just saw?"). This allows me to mentally prepare or decline.</li>
            <li><strong>Intent Matters:</strong> You may not share such content for the primary purpose of shocking, harassing, or intimidating me. This is determined by objective factors such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>A lack of the warning described in (1).</li>
                    <li>The content being directed at me or a real person in a threatening manner.</li>
                    <li>Continuing to send such content after a request to stop.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Academic/Artistic Sharing:</strong> Academic, artistic, or informational sharing of sensitive themes is permitted, provided it adheres to points 1 and 2. The key distinction is whether the content is being discussed or being weaponized.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>3.4. Good-Faith Interpretation</h3>
        <p>These Terms are a framework for a respectful interaction, not a checklist for finding violations. I will interpret and enforce them with the understanding that you are engaging in good faith. Minor, unintentional missteps are not the target of these rules. Their purpose is to address clear, persistent, or severe disruptions to my boundaries.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Article 4: Mutual Privacy and Confidentiality</h2>
        <h3>4.1. Our Mutual Obligation</h3>
        <p>Our Chat is a private dialogue. We both agree to maintain the confidentiality of any Private Information shared within it. "Private Information" refers to any personal, non-public details disclosed by either of us, including but not limited to: legal name, contact information, residential location, workplace, and other sensitive biographical or personal data.</p>
        
        <h3>4.2. My Commitment to You</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I will handle your Private Information with respect and will not disclose it to any third party.</li>
            <li>This obligation persists unless you give me explicit permission to share it, or if disclosure is required by law or is necessary to protect the safety of myself or others.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>4.3. Your Commitment to Me</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You agree not to disclose, share, or publish my Private Information.</li>
            <li>This obligation persists for a period of two years after our last communication, or until the information becomes publicly available through a source independent of you.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>4.4. What is Not Confidential</h3>
        <p>The fact that a conversation occurred between us is not, by itself, considered Private Information. This clause is intended to protect personal data, not to silence you about the existence of our interaction.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Article 5: Intellectual Property</h2>
        <h3>5.1. Ownership</h3>
        <p>The original content I create and share within the Chat remains my intellectual property. Similarly, the content you provide remains yours.</p>
        
        <h3>5.2. Usage Restrictions</h3>
        <p>Neither of us may reproduce, distribute, modify, or publicly display the other's proprietary content from the Chat without the other's explicit written permission.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Article 6: Data and Communication</h2>
        <h3>6.1. Platform Security</h3>
        <p>While we both expect a private conversation, the confidentiality of our Chat is ultimately dependent on the security of the platform we use, and neither of us can guarantee it.</p>
        
        <h3>6.2. Your Data Handling</h3>
        <p>I will handle any personal data you share with respect for your privacy. My principles are to not share your information with third parties without your consent, except as required by law or to protect the safety of myself or others.</p>
        
        <h3>6.3. My Data Handling</h3>
        <p>You are bound by the confidentiality obligations in Article 4 regarding my personal information. Beyond that, you are responsible for managing your own data and may request the deletion of your personal data from my records. I will honor such requests within 30 days, and will delete any personal data I hold that is not stored on a platform I do not control (e.g., Discord's servers). I will only refuse deletion if I am legally obligated to retain the information (e.g., for an ongoing law enforcement matter) or if it is necessary to retain the absolute minimum information required to maintain a block (e.g., a platform username to prevent future contact) due to a prior serious violation of these Terms that threatened my safety.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Article 7: Management of the Interaction</h2>
        <h3>7.1. My Rights</h3>
        <p>To protect my personal well-being and uphold the boundaries set in these Terms, I reserve the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cease responding to any message at any time.</li>
            <li>Block your account on any platform.</li>
            <li>Report violations to platform authorities or law enforcement.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>7.2. Discretion</h3>
        <p>As outlined in Article 1, these actions are undertaken at my discretion to manage my personal digital spaces.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Article 8: Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <h3>8.1. My Decisions Are Typically Final</h3>
        <p>My decision to block or cease communication is made to protect my well-being and is not open to debate. Engaging in arguments about a block is exactly the kind of draining interaction I seek to avoid.</p>
        
        <h3>8.2. An Opportunity for Genuine Mistakes</h3>
        <p>However, I am a reasonable person. If you believe you were blocked due to a clear misunderstanding (e.g., mistaken identity) or you have had a genuine change of heart and wish to apologize, you may contact me to request reconsideration.</p>
        
        <h3>8.3. How to Reach Out</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Respect the Block:</strong> Do not circumvent it by creating new accounts on the same platform.</li>
            <li><strong>Use a Different Channel:</strong> Contact me via a platform where you are not blocked. The most reliable way is via email at septenquinquagintillion@gmail.com.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep it Human:</strong> A simple, respectful message is all that's needed. Just explain your perspective calmly. A demand or an argument will end the conversation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>8.4. No Guarantees</h3>
        <p>Reaching out does not guarantee a response or an unblock. I will listen, but I am not obligated to change my decision. This is a chance for clarity, not a negotiation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Article 9: Modifications to Terms</h2>
        <h3>9.1. Updates</h3>
        <p>I may update these Terms periodically. The most current version will be posted at [Link to a permanent page, e.g., your blog, Linktree, or social media bio].</p>
        
        <h3>9.2. Acceptance of Changes</h3>
        <p>Your continued communication with me after any update constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Article 10: General Provisions</h2>
        <h3>10.1. Severability</h3>
        <p>If any part of these Terms is found to be invalid, the remainder will continue in full force and effect.</p>
        
        <h3>10.2. No Waiver</h3>
        <p>My failure to enforce a provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of my right to do so later.</p>
        
        <h3>10.3. Entire Agreement</h3>
        <p>These Terms represent the complete understanding between us regarding the Chat.</p>
        
        <h3>10.4. Cross-Platform Application</h3>
        <p>For consistency, these Terms apply to our interactions across all digital platforms and account handles I operate. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Discord: @other1side</li>
            <li>Tumblr: @othersideeeeeee</li>
            <li>Reddit: u/othersideeeee</li>
            <li>Steam: Other1Side</li>
            <li>And any other platform where I maintain a presence.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, the enforcement action of blocking across multiple platforms is reserved for significant and wilful violations of these Terms, such as serious harassment, threats, or a concerted effort to circumvent a block on one platform. A simple disagreement or minor violation on one platform will not automatically lead to action on all others. This cross-platform enforcement is a safety measure reserved for situations where a user demonstrates a pattern of harmful behavior that necessitates a comprehensive block.</p>
